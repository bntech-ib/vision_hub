# Image Display Issue Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing Storage Symlink**: The `public/storage` symlink was missing, which is required to serve files from the `storage/app/public` directory.

2. **Incorrect Disk Usage in Image Model**: The Image model was using the default disk to generate URLs, but images were being stored in the 'public' disk.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Created Storage Symlink
```bash
php artisan storage:link
```
This command creates a symbolic link from `public/storage` to `storage/app/public`, allowing web access to files stored in the public storage disk.

### 2. Updated Image Model
Changed the `getUrlAttribute` method in `app/Models/Image.php` to use the 'public' disk instead of the default disk:

```php
/**
 * Get the full URL for the image
 */
public function getUrlAttribute(): string
{
    return Storage::disk('public')->url($this->file_path);
}
```

## How Images Are Handled

1. **Upload Process** (ImageController):
   - Images are stored in `storage/app/public/images/YYYY/MM/` directory
   - File paths are saved in the database (e.g., `images/2025/10/test.png`)

2. **URL Generation** (Image Model):
   - URLs are generated using `Storage::disk('public')->url($file_path)`
   - This creates URLs like `http://localhost:8000/storage/images/2025/10/test.png`

3. **Web Access**:
   - The symlink at `public/storage` points to `storage/app/public`
   - Web requests to `/storage/images/2025/10/test.png` are served from `storage/app/public/images/2025/10/test.png`

## Verification

The fix has been verified by testing URL generation:
```
http://localhost:8000/storage/images/2025/10/test.png
```

## Additional Notes

- Images uploaded through other parts of the system (advertisements, profile images, etc.) were already working correctly because they use the 'public' disk consistently.
- The issue was specific to the ImageController and Image model where there was a mismatch between storage disk and URL generation disk.
