# Ad Controller Null Package Fix

## Issue
The application was throwing the error "Attempt to read property 'ad_views_limit' on null" when users without an active package tried to access advertisements or ad statistics.

## Root Cause
The code was trying to access properties on `$user->currentPackage` without properly checking if the relationship existed. When a user doesn't have an active package, `$user->currentPackage` can be null, causing the error when trying to access properties like `ad_views_limit` or `ad_limits`.

## Files Modified

### 1. app/Http/Controllers/API/AdController.php
- Fixed the [index](file:///business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/vendor/league/flysystem/src/Filesystem.php#L200-L209) method to check if `$user->currentPackage` exists before accessing `ad_limits`
- Fixed the [getStats](file:///business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/app/Http/Controllers/API/AdController.php#L502-L534) method to check if `$user->currentPackage` exists before accessing `ad_views_limit`

### 2. app/Models/User.php
- Fixed the [hasReachedDailyAdInteractionLimit](file:///business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/app/Models/User.php#L792-L817) method to safely access `ad_views_limit`
- Fixed the [getRemainingDailyAdInteractions](file:///business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/app/Models/User.php#L820-L843) method to safely access `ad_views_limit`
- Fixed the [getAvailableAdsQuery](file:///business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/app/Models/User.php#L885-L911) method to check if `$user->currentPackage` exists before accessing `ad_limits`

## Changes Made

### Before (Problematic Code):
```php
if ($user->hasActivePackage() && $user->currentPackage->ad_limits > 0) {
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```php
if ($user->hasActivePackage() && $user->currentPackage && $user->currentPackage->ad_limits > 0) {
```

Similar fixes were applied to all places where `$user->currentPackage` properties were accessed.

## How It Works
1. The code now first checks if the user has an active package using `hasActivePackage()`
2. Then it checks if `$user->currentPackage` is not null before accessing any properties
3. This prevents the "Attempt to read property on null" error
4. Users without packages can now access advertisements and statistics without errors

## Testing
A new test file `tests/Feature/AdControllerNullPackageTest.php` was created to verify:
- Users without packages can retrieve advertisements
- Users without packages can get ad statistics
- No errors occur when accessing package properties on null objects

## Benefits
- Prevents fatal errors for users without active packages
- Maintains functionality for users with active packages
- Improves application stability and user experience
- Follows defensive programming practices
