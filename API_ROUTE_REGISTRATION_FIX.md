# API Route Registration Fix

## Problem
The API routes were not being registered properly, causing 404 errors when accessing endpoints like `/api/v1/auth/login`. This was due to a conflict between the old Laravel routing approach and the new Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration.

## Root Cause
1. The application was using the new Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration in `bootstrap/app.php` with `apiPrefix: 'api/v1'`
2. However, the old `RouteServiceProvider.php` was still active and also prefixing API routes with `api/v1`
3. This created a double prefix, resulting in routes like `/api/v1/api/v1/auth/login` instead of `/api/v1/auth/login`
4. Additionally, the RouteServiceProvider was conflicting with the new bootstrap approach

## Solution
1. **Removed RouteServiceProvider.php** - Deleted the file since we're using the new Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration
2. **Updated route file comments** - Modified comments in all route files to reflect the new Laravel 12 approach:
   - `routes/api.php`
   - `routes/web.php`
   - `routes/admin.php`

## Changes Made

### 1. Deleted Files
- `app/Providers/RouteServiceProvider.php` - Removed conflicting route service provider

### 2. Updated Comments in Route Files
- Updated comments in `routes/api.php` to reflect Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration
- Updated comments in `routes/web.php` to reflect Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration
- Updated comments in `routes/admin.php` to reflect Laravel 12 bootstrap configuration

## Verification
After these changes, the API routes should be properly registered with the correct prefix `/api/v1/` and accessible without double prefixing issues.

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Run `php artisan route:list` to check that API routes are registered correctly
2. Try accessing an API endpoint like `POST /api/v1/auth/login` to ensure it's working
3. Check that all other API endpoints are accessible with the correct `/api/v1/` prefix

This fix ensures that the application uses only the new Laravel 12 routing configuration and eliminates conflicts between different routing approaches.
