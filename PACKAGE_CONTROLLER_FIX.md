# Package Controller Fix

## Issue
The available packages endpoint was returning an empty array `{"success":true,"data":[],"message":"Available packages retrieved successfully"}` because the API controller was looking for `Package` models, but the database seeder was creating `UserPackage` models.

## Root Cause
There were two different package models in the system:
1. `App\Models\Package` - Used by the API controller
2. `App\Models\UserPackage` - Used by the database seeder and most of the application

The seeder was creating records in the `user_packages` table, but the API controller was querying the `packages` table, which was empty.

## Solution
Modified the `API\PackageController` to use `UserPackage` instead of `Package` to ensure consistency with the rest of the application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API PackageController
- Changed all references from `Package` to `UserPackage`
- Updated the `available()` method to query `UserPackage` models
- Updated all other methods (index, store, show, update, destroy) to use `UserPackage`

### 2. Enhanced Validation
- Added validation for `daily_earning_limit` and `ad_limits` fields which are required in `UserPackage`
- Added validation for `referral_earning_percentage` field

### 3. Updated Route Model Binding
- Updated method signatures to use `UserPackage` type hints
- Ensured route model binding works correctly with `UserPackage`

## Files Modified
1. `app/Http/Controllers/API/PackageController.php` - Main fix
2. `tests/Feature/AvailablePackagesTest.php` - Added tests to verify the fix

## How It Works
1. The API controller now queries the `user_packages` table instead of the `packages` table
2. Only active packages (`is_active = true`) are returned by the `available()` method
3. Packages are ordered by price in ascending order
4. All package fields are properly validated on create/update operations

## Testing
The fix has been tested with:
- Retrieving available packages when they exist
- Returning empty array when no active packages exist
- Proper ordering of packages by price
- Validation of required fields

All tests pass successfully, confirming the implementation works as expected.

## Benefits
- Resolves the empty array issue for the available packages endpoint
- Maintains consistency with the rest of the application which uses `UserPackage`
- Provides proper validation for package fields
- Ensures route model binding works correctly
