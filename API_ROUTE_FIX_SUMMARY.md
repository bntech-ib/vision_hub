# VisionHub API Route Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The API endpoint `POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/login` was returning a 404 (Not Found) error.

## Root Cause
There was a double prefixing issue in the API route configuration:
1. **RouteServiceProvider.php** was already prefixing API routes with `api/v1`
2. **routes/api.php** file also had an additional `Route::prefix('api/v1')` wrapper

This caused routes to be registered as `/api/v1/api/v1/{endpoint}` instead of `/api/v1/{endpoint}`.

## Fix Applied
Removed the redundant `Route::prefix('api/v1')` wrapper from the **routes/api.php** file, keeping only the prefix configuration in **RouteServiceProvider.php**.

## Files Modified
- **[routes/api.php](file:///c%3A/business/visionHub/app/visionhub-backend/routes/api.php)**: Removed the redundant prefix wrapper

## Verification
After the fix, the following endpoints should now work correctly:
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login`
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register`
- `GET /api/v1/auth/user`
- And all other API endpoints

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/auth/login` - it should no longer return 404
2. Test other API endpoints to ensure they're working correctly
3. Check that the route list shows correct paths (using `php artisan route:list`)

## Prevention
To avoid similar issues in the future:
1. Always check RouteServiceProvider for existing route prefixes
2. Maintain a single source of truth for route prefixing
3. Use `php artisan route:list` to verify route paths after making changes
